    <h1 style="color: white;">      <center> MY SELF </center> </h1>
<p> <h3 style="color: white;"> 
      My name is Saheed Irahim. I live in Agbado, ogun state. I am a Nigerian. I am the second born of my parent. We are four in number and I have always felt responsible for my family. I love my parents and siblings dearly and the feeling is mutual.
    
    My father is basically a business man and my mother is an House wife. I have a stable family and we are quite grounded in our beliefs and notions. My parents are attentive to my needs and my siblings. They can be strict when they have to be, but  I know they mean well.

<h3 style="color: white;">  I just grduated from SS3 from Nana Apori Comprehensive High school. I have a stable grade and  I get by quite well. My favorite subjects are Biology, English and History. I love to draw, paint and read books. This is how I often clear my head or de-stress myself. I desire to go to the university and obtain a degree in any science related course(software programming). This will help me to become a successful person and also impact the lives of others while I am at it.

    I cannot claim that I love school and I don’t hate school either, I guess I’m just indifferent. Although, I love my BIOLOGY classes and MATHEMATICS lessons too. People are nice to me in school, I don’t get bullied and I rarely ever get punished by my teachers nor have I been asked to report to the principal’s office.    
    I am Introverted. My friends say that I  fun to be with. I sometimes go out of my way to be nice to people and help them out. I guess this is rooted in my sense of responsibility which was honed into me by my parents considering that I am the first son(and only) of my family. Friendship and family mean a lot to me. I can go all out for my friends and my family and they know it. I think this is why I have had the same set of friends for years. We have transitioned from friends to family.     </h3>

<h3 style="color: white;"> I’m always looking for ways to develop my skills and learn new things not just in school but outside the school environment. I share ideas with my friends, we learn interesting things about one another, and most of the people I associate with I met with while on the lookout for ways to advance my skills.
    I have every intention to make the world a better place. I know I’m no superman and I have no concrete plans right now, but I am on a road to discovery. I feel happy and enthusiastic about my future. . I know I’m on the right track and soon enough I’ll be close to where I want to be.     </h3>
